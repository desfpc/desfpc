## 💼 About Me

I'm a backend developer with over 18 years of experience building scalable, reliable systems in production environments. I've worked with companies across Russia, Serbia, Germany, China, and Australia, delivering everything from government portals and e-commerce platforms to high-load backend infrastructures for games and marketplaces.

My key traits:
- Passion for **code quality** and **architecture**
- Strong background in **PHP** and **Go**
- Experience leading teams and mentoring junior developers
- Prefer **Extreme Programming (XP)** values over rigid architectural formalism
- Advocate of **TDD**, **DDD**, and **continuous improvement**

## 🧠 Philosophy

- Pragmatist, leaning toward **Extreme Programming (XP)** — quick iterations, real feedback, collective code ownership, and evolving architecture.
- Not a fan of "Clean Architecture" as an ideology — prefer practical solutions tailored to the domain and problem.
- Believe in building lightweight, custom solutions where frameworks add unnecessary complexity.
- Prefer understanding what happens under the hood — whether it’s your own codebase or a third-party tool.
